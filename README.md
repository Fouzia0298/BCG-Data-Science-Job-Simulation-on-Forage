# 📊 BCG Data Science Job Simulation on Forage - June 2025  
## Customer Churn Analysis for XYZ Analytics  

This repository contains my solution to the **BCG Data Science Virtual Job Simulation by Forage**, where I performed an end-to-end customer churn analysis for a fictional analytics firm, *XYZ Analytics*. The simulation tested skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, modeling, and strategic insight communication.

## 🧠 Project Overview  

In this simulation, I was tasked with analyzing client data to predict and understand **customer churn**. My responsibilities included:  

- Interpreting datasets and identifying key variables impacting churn.  
- Conducting data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Performing exploratory data analysis and visualizing trends.  
- Building and optimizing a machine learning model to predict churn.  
- Delivering insights and actionable recommendations to the Associate Director.

## 🔬 Key Tasks & Deliverables  

### 1. **Data Exploration & Strategy**  
- Analyzed the dataset to identify important features such as `cons_12m`, `forecast_cons_12m`, `net_margin`, and `has_gas`.  
- Outlined a structured approach for investigating churn, including segmentation by consumption patterns and sales channels.

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handled missing values, inconsistent categories, and irrelevant columns.  
- Used **Pandas** and **NumPy** to transform and prepare the data for modeling.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
- Leveraged **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to uncover trends and correlations between client demographics, usage patterns, and churn likelihood.  
- Identified key factors influencing churn risk through visualizations and statistical summaries.

### 4. **Model Development & Evaluation**  
- Engineered and trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **85%**, demonstrating strong predictive performance.  
- Evaluated using **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix** to ensure robustness and reliability.

### 5. **Executive Summary**  
- Prepared a concise summary for the Associate Director outlining:  
  - High-risk customer segments  
  - Key drivers of churn  
  - Strategic recommendations for retention initiatives
